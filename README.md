# README
Reupload of my Game Lab 1 Project in University (2022-2023)
This was mostly a playground to learn shaders with for me.

# Renderer: Compute Shader with Raymarching
The renderer is NOT performant and was written with close to no prior experience in that field.
It uses a dynamic voxeliser, which is not performant for graphics cards currently and was written for fun.

I've learnt from the pitfalls I fell into, might come back and remake this better :)
